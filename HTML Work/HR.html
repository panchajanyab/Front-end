    <p>
        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.

        Two players from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket, 
        with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch.

        The fielding team tries to prevent runs from being scored by dismissing batters (so they are "out").
         Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket.
